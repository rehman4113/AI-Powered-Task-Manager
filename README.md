# AI-Powered-Task-Manager
This project's core is a Spring Boot backend that exposes RESTful APIs for comprehensive task management (CRUD operations). It seamlessly integrates with an NLP layer (Node.js) which transforms natural language commands into structured intents, enabling the Spring Boot application to intelligently manage tasks based on user voice and text input.
